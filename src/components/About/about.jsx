            <p>
              Flyfishing got me into baitbuilding. When my interest in fishing
              grew bigger, I was actually more into flyfishing. I would still
              rate flyfishing as the ultimate form of fishing. There’s just
              something to it, it’s hard to explain, it’s the complete package.
            </p>

            <p>
              I primarily wanted to fish after trout and around the place I grew
              up in Sweden there wasn’t that many waters with good troutfishing,
              but plenty of waters with good populations of pike and zander. So
              due to the fact that it more convenient, trolling and spinfishing
              for pike and zander became the primary fishing methods and
              flyfishing took a step back.

              But the thing about flyfishing is that you often tie the flies you
              fish with. In contrast when spinfishing, trolling or in general
              when you’re not flyfishing, you tend to buy lures from the tackle
              shop. I missed the feeling when catching fish on something built
              by myself. The creative process and the fact that I could make a
              lure exactly how I wanted it, those where things that got me
              started with baitbuilding. So back in 2015 I made my first lures
              and since then it’s one of my favorite things to do besides
              fishing.
